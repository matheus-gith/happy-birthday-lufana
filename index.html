                <p>
                    I made this "website" to wish you a happy birthday, I'm still learning so it's not that good but I hope you like it.
                <p>
                    Happy birthday Lufana, I'm going to say some things I think about the girl you are, you're incredible, hardworking (very hardworking),
                    intelligent, friendly, you have a unique way, I would say, your tastes 
                    they are incredible, the way you dress, your style itself is incredible,
                    You are an amazing girl and today is your special day, a truly special day.
                    special day, you deserve all the most beautiful things on this day 
                    life and you deserve to make all your dreams come true
                    you will do it, I'm sure, because you are fully capable of it, (you deserve the world), 
                    I swear when I sat down at the computer to write this there were so many
                    things to write, but now there don't seem to be so many, I wouldn't be a good writer
                    unless someone could read my thoughts and write to me
                    Anyway, what I want to say is that I really wish you all the best, 
                    May God continue to be part of your essence, because that is beautiful in you,
                    So may you continue to be the amazing girl that you are, I hope your day today is amazing and that you have a lot of fun
                    I also want to say that you are someone extremely special to me and you will always be one of my favorite people, I love you ♥️♥️♥️.

                    I did it in English to make it more beautiful.
